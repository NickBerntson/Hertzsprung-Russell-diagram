# Hertzsprung-Russell-diagram
I utilized Python and Matplotlib to create a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which visualizes star luminosity vs. temperature for stellar classification. Temperature (Kelvin) and luminosity (solar units) are rounding values for clearer visualization and easier interpretation. Stars are catagorized into groups (Super Giants, Giants, Main Sequence, White Dwarfs) to highlight differences in physical properties. 
*All of this deliveres a clean, informative scatter plot to support understanding of stellar behavior.
